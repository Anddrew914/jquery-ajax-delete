## AJAX :: Asynchronous JavaScript

##### _'A is for Asynchronous'_

At a very low level, computers are built on processors, little electrical machines that accept one instruction at a time at more-or-less constant speed. This speed is controlled by a system within the chip called a clock; the clock acts like revolving door, allowing instructions to be entered into the chip only when they're in sync with the clock. This is called a **synchronous** system. However, sometimes things happen _outside_ that are out of sync with the clock (**asynchronous**) and need to be handled immediately by interrupting the normal flow of the program.

What does this all have to do with web development? Well, similar to the chip example, our typical software programs run synchronously. Each command corresponds to some set of instructions at the chip level, and each of these instructions is run one at a time, in order. But sometimes, things happen. Specifically, in the case of JavaScript, **events** happen. When those things happen, JavaScript has tools called **event listeners** which respond to events whenever they might appear, and a system called the **event loop** which inserts the responses to those events into the normal flow of the program. You have seen these already - you've written jQuery code to respond to asynchronous events like clicks and keypresses. But there are more things than user actions that we can be listening to... H

Consider the function `SetTimeout`. `SetTimeout` is one of the most basic asynchronous functions in JavaScript; it sets an event listener to trigger after a certain number of milliseconds (second argument) have passed, and specifies an event-handling function (first argument) to run whenever the timer is up.

```
var sayHello = Æ’(){
  console.log("Say Hello");
};

// 5 seconds
var numMilliseconds = 5000;

setTimeout(sayHello, numMilliseconds);

console.log("Say Goodbye");
```

run this file

```
node async_timeout.js
```

Notice how the sayHello function is being executed asynchronously. We actually wait five seconds before we execute the function passed to setTimeout, causing `"Say Goodbye"` to actually get printed _before_ `"Say Hello"`.

### Asynchronous JavaScript :: Lab

Consider the following recipe for chocolate cake.

> Note: This is not a real recipe! Don't expect it to actually produce cake. :-)

1. Warm up oven to 325 degrees for 10 minutes.
2. Put three eggs in a mixing bowl.
3. Melt a 1/4 pound of chocolate on a very low flame for 5 minutes.
4. Add 2 cups of flour in the mixing bowl and mix vigorously.
5. Add 1/3 stick of melted butter to the mixing bowl.
6. Pour melted chocolate into bowl and mix.
7. Pour contents of bowl into a cake pan.
8. Put cake pan in the oven for 25 minutes.

In pairs, walk through how you would follow this Recipe in a synchronous manner. Then, walk through how you would follow this Recipe in a asynchronous manner.

Next create a JavaScript file called `asynchronous-cake.js` to represent the recipe. Your code should print out "Completed Step X : ... " after completing each step of the recipe; use `setTimeout` (replacing 1 minute in the recipe with 1 second in your code) to let your code work asynchronously.

## AJAX

AJAX stands for **Asynchronous Javascript And XML**; it's a system (actually, a set of systems) that allows us to asynchronously make HTTP requests and set callbacks to handle whatever we get back.

> XML is hardly ever used anymore, really; JSON is much more common now.*

In particular, we're going to look at jQuery's _implementation_ of AJAX, through some of its built-in methods (such as `.ajax` and `.get`).
However, in order for our AJAX to work, there needs to be an API behind it, so let's set that up first.

### AJAX GET :: Code-Along

First, we're going to start up a server that provides an API. The API will be for *Person* resources. This backend server will also serve up all the static files, (html,js,css, ...) in the public directory.

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `bundle install`
- run `rackup -p 3333 people_server.ru` from the root of the repo. This command will start up a server on port 3333.

Let's explore what the backend Person API is.  

**Make an HTTP GET request to /people. Get the resource as json.**

```
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:3333/people
```

**Make an HTTP GET request to /people. Get the resource as HTML.**

```
curl -v -H "Accept: text/html" http://localhost:3333/people
```

**Make an HTTP GET request to /people/3. Get the resource as json.**

```
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:3333/people/3
```

Now do the above again using your browser.

> You may want to install the [JSON Prettifier](http://goo.gl/0ueVkS) or [JSON Formatter](http://goo.gl/ZDLWY0) Chrome extensions; these tools make JSON more readable when viewed from a browser window.

<hr>

OK! Now let's make some more requests to the backend API - this time, however, we're going to do it by using AJAX GET.

1. **Create a public/index.html file.**

    ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>AJAX GET</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="description" content="">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
      </head>
      <body>
        <header>
          <h1>AJAX GET</h1>
        </header>
        <div id='container'>
          <div id='messagesDiv'></div>
        </div>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="js/people_get.js"></script>

      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    This is a pretty standard HTML file; it loads jQuery and one other JavaScript file.

2. **Create a public/js/people_get.js file.**

    ```
    $(document).ready(function(){

      var getPeople = function(data){
        $('#container').html(data);
      };
      var errorHandler = function(jqXHR,textStatus,errorThrown){
        var msg = "Request Failed: "+ textStatus;
        alert(msg);
        console.log(msg);
      };

      $.ajax({
        url: '/people',
        dataType: 'html'
      })
        .done(getPeople)
        .fail(errorHandler)
        .always(function(){ console.log('Finished AJAX GET Request'); });

      // We could also have written this as
      //   var request = $.ajax({ ... });
      //   request.done(getPeople);
      //   request.fail(errorHandler);
      //   request.always(function(){ console.log('Finished AJAX GET Request'); });  
      // And, of course, we could also have used either named or anonymous functions for any of these callbacks.

    });
    ```

  Lets review what's going on here.

  * All code is wrapped in our `$(document).ready`, so it will be executed ONLY after the DOM is fully loaded.

  * We called JQuery's `ajax` method, which accepts an object of settings as a parameter, and returns a 'request' object.
   > _To be precise, it returns a [JQXHR](http://api.jquery.com/Types/#jqXHR) object; for more details, look up `$.ajax` in the jQuery documentation._

  * Then, we called that 'request' object's `done` method, passing in a callback that would used to handle AJAX GET responses from the backend. The `done` method then returns the original 'request' object.
   >_The specific callback above, `getPeople`, takes the data it gets from the server and inserts it, as text, into the #container div._

  * Next, we called that 'request' object's `fails` method, passing in a callback that would be used to process errors.
   >_The specific callback above, `errorHandler` takes the error's status code and creates an alert dialog from it._

  * Finally, we called the 'request' object's `always` method, passing in a callback that we always want to run after the request, whether it was or was not successful.
  >_The `done` and `fail` callbacks are almost always specified, but `always` is only used sometimes. Weird, right?_

3. **Run Our JS and Send the AJAX GET Request.**

  a. Open http://localhost:3333 in your browser. This will load the HTML returned from the API into the page.

  b. Change the representation of the resource we're looking for from HTML to JSON; since JSON representation ('application/json' mime-type) is the default, we just need to remove the dataType property.

  ```
  $.ajax({
      url: '/people',
    })

  ```

  c. Reopen http://localhost:3333 in your browser; this will load the JSON returned from the API into the page.

4. **Use the Response Data to Render HTML**

  To do this, we need to edit our `getPeople` function. Rather than simply plopping our data (which, you might note, has already been converted from JSON to a JS object) into the `#container` div wholesale, let's iterate over each item in our data and append HTML bit by bit. You should have a sense for how to do this part already...
