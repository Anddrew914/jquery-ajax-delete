# jQuery AJAX DELETE

## Prerequisites

-   [http-study](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/http-study)
-   [json-study](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/json-study)

## Objectives

Make HTTP requests using `curl`, and AJAX for:

-   Deleting a resource.

Use response data in future requests

## Preparation

Set up the client:

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Create and checkout a new branch (training).
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

We'll make requests of and receive responses from an HTTP server we'll set up
 together:

1.  Open a new terminal (window or tab).
1.  Change into the directory where your library-api lives
1.  Run `rails s` or `rails server`(they do the same thing)

We're now ready to make requests.
